# Project_0

List of goals :
1. Code a x bit adder in VHDL
    1.1. code a half adder
    1.2. code a full adder
    1.3. put it together and get the x bit adder (might need to use templates and pythons to generate the wanted size of adder)
2. Arrengement of HDLs. Generate two possibilities :
    2.1. Keep all HDLs in different files
    2.2. Put all HDLs in one file
3. Obfuscating
    3.1. Simply changes all the I/O, variables names to any the names
    3.2. Implement an AES in Python
    3.3. Add the possibility to obfuscate the code or not (the 2 possibilities in 2. must be taken into account)
